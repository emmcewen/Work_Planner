## WORK_PLANNER
This project was designed as a homework assignment for OSU's Bootcamp Course.

My quiz application uses HTML, CSS,Javascript and Jquery for its framework and functionality. This application highlights the implementation of Javascript for local storage to display items and keep them on the page when the page is refreshed. The work pulls the current date and time and allows the user to enter in events so they can keep track of their day. 

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To play the coding quiz click on the deployment link to get started.
